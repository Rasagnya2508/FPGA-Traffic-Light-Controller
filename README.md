# FPGA-Based Traffic Light Controller with Priority System

## Overview
This project implements a smart traffic light controller using Verilog on a Xilinx Spartan FPGA. It includes an emergency vehicle priority override mechanism.

## Features
- Normal traffic light sequencing
- Priority override for emergency vehicles
- Implemented in Verilog
- Simulated using ModelSim/Vivado

## Files Included
- `controller.v`: Verilog code for traffic control logic
- `testbench.v`: Testbench for simulation
- `Report.pdf`: Full project documentation
- `Presentation.pptx`: Project presentation
- `BlockDiagram.png`: System architecture diagram

## Tools Used
- Xilinx Vivado / ModelSim for simulation
- Xilinx Spartan FPGA Board
